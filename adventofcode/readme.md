# Advent of Code Coding Challenges

2020 Coding Challenges provided by [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

every day consists of two challenges. unfortunately the second can only be seen after the first has been solved correctly





note to self:
in the course of a small tidying up session the solutions where moved on folder-level up by simply copying them into
the directory one level above... this messed the timestamps up which now are lost forever :( --> dont do this again
