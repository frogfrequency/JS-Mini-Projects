Master_build.js should be the most advanced version of all the poker "tryouts"

the programm can generate random hands consisting of seven cards. 
it then evaluates your hand and increases the according counter (i.e. pair-counter or flush-counter)
you can generate thousands or millions of hands and simulate the distribution of possibilites.


it coincides with the probability-tables from wikipedia (A,2,3,4,5 -straights are not yet detected 
correctly... therefore the table is very slightly off. but the fact remains, that it works..


in this folder there is only the more or less finished version.

to see how it all evolved go to:
