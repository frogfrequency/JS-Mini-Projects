# Mini-Projects

This is a repository for various mini coding-projects written in javascript and sometimes supplemented with HTML & CSS

as it is a very "prototypy" area it is bound to turn into an untidy mess after a while. 
it should be cleaned up from time to time.
---> (maybe copy content into separate folder(s) ? maybe one for finished and nice projects and one to keep the remaining "mess" for archiving purposes?)

#### Project List:

- [fibonacci](fibonacci)
- [gridCreation](gridCreation)
- [pixelEstimator](pixelEstimator)
- [pixelEstimator_V2](pixelEstimator_V2)
- [spotlightSUM](spotlightSUM)
- [waves](waves)

this above-mentioned list is just a showcase of its functionality and is certainly never up to date!

### --- a few noteworthy projects: ---

- [a working chess board](simulators/chess/chess_v1_redesign)
- [Advent of Code Coding Challenges](adventofcode)
- [buggy ball movement](simulators/sim_1)
- [poker probability simulator](JS-only-projects/Poker/poker-master-build)
- [little guessing programm](pixelEstimator_V2)
- [a very basic paint clone](drawing-programms/Paint_V1)

When working on new features or tasks, create new branches with naming pattern:

- task/my-current-task-description
- feature/my-current-feature-description

If you are working on a bugfix, create new branches with naming pattern:

- fix/my-current-problem
- bugfix/my-current-problem
